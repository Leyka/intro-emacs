#+title: Intro Org Mode

* Hello World

This is an introduction to ~emacs~ and ~org-mode~.

Most of what I will write will come from tutorials, or things I learned myself. Let's have fun!

* Common Emacs Vocabulary
** Buffer
A buffer is a region of memory used to hold text that you are editing. Each file you open, as well as temporary texts like help messages, are displayed in buffers.
** Window
A window in Emacs refers to a portion of the Emacs frame where a buffer is displayed. You can split a frame into multiple windows.
** Frame
An Emacs frame is what most applications would call a window (the whole application window that can contain multiple Emacs windows).
** ~M~
 Refers to Meta key such as ~Alt~ or ~Option~
** ~C~
Refers to ~Ctrl~ key (example `C c` means Ctrl+C)
